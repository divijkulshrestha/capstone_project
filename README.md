# CSE 4099: Capstone Project
## by Divij Kulshrestha [17BCE2116] and Mohith J [17BCE2135]

This repo contains Python code for the Heroku [web application](https://pollution-forecast.herokuapp.com/) we built for our capstone project. 

**As of Dec 2022, this project is now hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud - [here!](https://github.com/divijkulshrestha/capstone_project)

# Aim
Our project aims to use machine learning to forecast the level of pollution (specifically, PM 2.5 values) for vairous urban Indian cities using publicly available pollution and meteorological data from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/), the Central Pollution Control Board website, and the [Reliable Prognosis Weather Archive](https://rp5.ru).

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:

    * streamlit
    * pandas
    * numpy
    * scikit-learn
    * xgboost
    * requests
    * pytz
    * pickle
